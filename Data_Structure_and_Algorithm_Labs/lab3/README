Requirement#1: Everything Works. 
Requirement#2: Everything Works.
Requirement#3: 
1. Implemented both InsertionSort and MergeSort using functions myCopy, mySwap, and myCompare, in order to measure 
the amount of comparisons and swaps used in each algorithm to measure the efficency of its worst, average, and best case.
2. 
Analysis of Insertion Sort: 
Best Case Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Comparsions:6-1 = 5 = n-1
Swaps:0  
Therefore, best case is T(n)= O(n)
Worst Case Input: 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Comparsions:20
Swaps:15 
Therefore, 20 + 15 = 35 = n^2 -1, 
Worst case is T(n) = O(n^2) 
Average Case: On average, it is Worst Case. Therefore, T(n) = O(n^2) 

Analysis of Merge Sort: 
Best Case Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Comparsions: 9 
Swaps: 16 
Therefore, 16 + 9 = 25 ~ n log n, T(n)= O(n log n)
Worst Case Input: 6 5 4 3 2 1
Comparsions: 7
Swaps: 16 
Therefore, 16 + 7 = 23 ~ n log n, T(n) = O(n^2)
Average Case: Since both best and worst have the same complexity, the average must have the same.
Therefore, T(n) = n log n.
